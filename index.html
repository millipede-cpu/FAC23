        <h2 class="title" id="My_Story">My Story</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the 90's in the Kentish countryside, just a short train to London,
      where I used to go and explore the city, mostly catching the Northern Line tube to Camden Town 
      with my friends, exploring the market, gothic clothes, and tasty street food.<br>
      From the time I could walk my Mother put both my sister and I up for ballet lessons, 
      we danced on the local theatre stage in our colourful tutus, performing lots of ballet shows, and Sleeping Beauty that was filmed on VHS! 
      I'm a part of the millennial generation, that has lived through the fastest progression of technology in history. From playing Snake on my Nokia 3310 
      brick sized mobile phone to Playstation 2 gaming to smart phones that are now the center of our lives. I had lots of pet rabbits growing up that were
      spoiled silly with vegetables and even had their own Bunny Castle that my Dad built and I painted. I was brought up vegetarian but I started eating meat 
      during my teenage rebellion years still feel guilty about eating animals that I think are cute though. I love drawing, baking creative cakes and getting 
      inspired by music, films & fashion.

    <h3 class="title" id="Why_Me_?">Why Me?</h3>
  
    <p>During the first lockdown I was furloughed from my job, dyed my hair crazy colours and suddenly I had all this free 
      time to focus on something new. I started to learn coding influenced by friends talking about how rewarding it was as a career 
      and also from the excitement I felt from seeing so many coder characters pop up on my radar, most poignantly Lisbeth Salander 
      from The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Elliot Alderson from Mr Robot.<br>
      While I realise that these characters are hackers and 
      their natural talent and insane cinematic lives do not reflect a web developement career, it opened up my imagination to how 
      code is pieced together like a puzzle and also how reliant we are as a society on apps, websites and the internet and how interesting 
      it would be to be a contributor. What I love about coding is the endless possibilities that you can create and the network of people that are
      virtually at your fingertips all helping and supporting each other. I've already learnt so much from studying coding online but to be a
      part of an intricate group of people all learning similar projects and working through them together would be amazingly rewarding and life changing.
      I'm applying for this apprenticeship to pursue my ambition of becoming a Web Developer and learn from and teach others with pair programming.</p>

    <h4 class="title" id="FAC">Founders and Coders</h4>
   
    <p>What I like about Founders and Coders is the welcoming coding community that they provide and the supportive atmosphere to show an attempt of a code algorithm, 
      however tangled it may be. While coding is becoming more of a competitive career path every year, they assure everyone that no question is silly to ask, 
      they're encouraged, as I've always found that learning is more fun with other people, and also the satisfaction of seeing what you're learning working. Coding is also 
      a whole world of specific languages with unique purposes and careers. The difference between Javascript language and French though, is the logical thought process of how we
      give a computer instructions to make projects and websites. 
      <br>
      
      Learning has always thrived better in a group, especially to get another 
      person's perspective on how you might've simply missed a semi-colon and that's why you couldn't get 
      your code to work! Founders and Coders also ask their current cohort members to mentor new applicants which is an innovative
      system, as people learn to code they pass on their knowledge.

    <h5 class="title" id="Illustration">Illustration</h5>
    
    <p>I studied Illustration at Solent University in Southampton, where I had great tutors that encouraged me to 
      experiment with new artistic mediums, I tried a mix of letter press, inks, pastels but my favourite materials to draw with
      are graphic fineliners and a waterbrush that blends colours together beautifully.
      <br>
      I get inspiration for my artwork from nature, music, films, stories, fashion, psychology, nightmares and dreams, I love drawing animals and imagining abstract ideas that
      defy reality, I was inspired by Van Gogh, Salvador Dali and Francis Bacon, all with unique and vibrant artistic styles.
      I have always been creative, whether I'm doing baking, singing, dancing ballet, drawing or web design, I could spend hours styling my CSS like a painting,
      but there's only so many hours in the day!
